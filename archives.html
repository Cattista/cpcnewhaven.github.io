  <h1>Christ Presbyterian Church</h1>
  
  <p>
    Christ Presbyterian Church, New Haven is a member of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). As one of many communions in the church universal, the PCA may be distinguished by its affirmation of what has been described as the "Reformed system of faith" as reflected in the Westminster Confession of Faith. The PCA is characterized by its emphasis on both personal revival and theological reformation. Without revival, reformation can become "dead orthodoxy." Without reformation, revival can result in shallow experientialism and misinformed zeal. By promoting reformation and revival, we seek to carry out the Great Commission with Biblical integrity and personal authenticity unto the glory of God.
  </p>

  <h2>Five Basic Commitments</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>We are committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures</h3>
      <p>
        While believing that God powerfully manifests His infinite glory in a general way through creation, our Christian faith and practice are grounded in God's works of redemption in history as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. We believe also that all special revelation has ceased until the next and final redemptive act of God in history when Christ will return to judge the living and the dead. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel of God's word, recognizing no other source for divine revelation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To liberate all of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving abuses.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>We are committed to the teachings of grace</h3>
      <p>
        Whereas the Holy Scriptures are our only rule of faith and practice, our Church unity is predicated upon a consensus about what the Scriptures principally teach. Our consensus is reflected in the 350-year-old Westminster Confession of Faith. In summary, it affirms that we are accepted by God, from beginning to end, not by our own works or attempts at being approved by God, but by faith alone in the perfect and all-sufficient work of Christ on our behalf, faith itself being the free gift of God!
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To affirm the sovereignty of grace, to connect us to wise men and women who have gone before us, and to prevent our historical and cultural blind spots.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>We are committed to God-centered worship</h3>
      <p>
        Our worship is set to the pattern of covenant initiation and renewal, including the weekly participation of the Lord's Supper. Our music and style of worship are "blended" to reflect the vernacular context of those God has brought to our city. Our desire is for our worship to be as God-centered as our theology, communicating the truth and grace of God to the nations. We welcome all believers together with those who are searching.
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Not only is it biblical, but it keeps us grounded in the gospel every week, secured upon Christ's redemption accomplished. Our worship embodies the gospel as we experience God's presence.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>We are committed to being a multi-cultural church and church planting movement</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that the church, the household of God, is an essential element of the gospel into which people of every tribe and nation are welcomed. It is, therefore, our ambition to be not only a growing church but also a growing church planting movement. Our aim is to plant churches that reach the different cultures in our city, New England, and the world.
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because no one culture is closer to God than another, you don't have to become American (or Western, or whatever!) to become Christian, and the corporate witness of the gospel is the best testament to its power!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>We are committed to a high view of Christian calling</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that God has placed into our lives the boundaries of our habitation that reflect His own sovereign design to accomplish His work in the world. His work extends into the spheres of family, church, and civil vocations. Our ultimate commitment is to the restoration of "calling" that we might more and more glorify God and enjoy Him forever!
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because God didn't make us just one way or with one part of ourselves, but made ALL of us, and He deserves it all to be offered as a thank offering.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Our Search For Total Christ Spirituality</h2>
  <p>
    You will see it all throughout our literature and printed on our bulletin covers—“that Christ might come to be first in everything” (Col.1:18-19). Yes, our name Christ Presbyterian Church really means that we want this to be all about Christ—his work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our ultimate affection and respect. But it needs to go beyond even this! It is our desire to experience total Christ not just one or another brand of Christ which would focus on one or another aspect of Christ’s ministry in our lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term “Total Christ” originates from the 5th century pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the relationship of Christ’s incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as “the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body.” It is our intention to reunite these spiritualities that in modern history tend to be separated. These churches place heavy emphasis on both the grace of the gospel and the importance of the church as the locus of missions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our search then is the search for Christ wherein it can be hopefully said that he is a “head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all” (Eph.1:22-23, also 2:19ff). In search of a holistic and healthy Christian life and church, the five marks of a "total Christ" spirituality are as follows:
  </p>

  <h3>1) GOSPEL-CENTERED:</h3>
  <p>
    We believe that the Gospel is not only the ABC’s but the A to Z’s of the Christian life in at least two ways. First, it is not only our ticket to heaven based on grace through faith, it is the way God sets us free to live the more transformed life. Second, the Gospel is not just about the “inward” person concerning our spiritual needs, but also the “outward” person concerned with our emotional, physical, vocational, etc. needs. The Gospel, therefore, is a holistic commitment to empowerment aimed at spiritual conversion and discipleship in reliance upon Christ together with micro-enterprise ventures and family/personal Christian counseling.
  </p>

  <h3>2) BEING MISSIONAL:</h3>
  <p>
    More than a source of mission, the carefully designed, apostolically-organized, church is the locus of mission and the very life-giving and mediated presence of Christ. Just the church being the church with the whole world present is God’s missionary strategy to the world. This makes our approach to evangelism and discipleship participatory and not simply declarative.
  </p>

  <h3>3) UNITED IN BELIEF:</h3>
  <p>
    Whereas the Scripture is our only rule of faith and practice, we want to read and interpret the scripture with the consensus of the church that is passed down from every age and place through the use of “confessions”. Our consensus is reflected in the Westminster Confession of Faith which is consistent with other familiar creeds such as the Apostles' and Nicene creeds. We strive to apply our beliefs to all of life and, in so doing, relate to Dorothy Sayers’ famous saying “the dogma is the drama!”
  </p>

  <h3>4) PARTICIPATING IN SACRAMENTAL WORSHIP:</h3>
  <p>
    We desire an emphasis on sacramental spirituality wherein Christ our Priest is “fleshed out” in a carefully designed four-movement worship service that follows the four movements of the gospel and culminates every week in a participation in eucharistic communion with Christ as “fleshed out” in cultural styles specific to each local community.
  </p>

  <h3>5) UNITED IN COMMUNITY:</h3>
  <p>
    We want to emphasize a local-oriented ministry where community really matters. This community formation occurs where Christ our King is fleshed out through life on life “one anothering” and holistic empowerment under the shepherding care of Christ’s under-shepherds and servant leaders.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Mission Anabaino (MA) is mission “I am ascending” (the meaning of the Greek word “anabaino” which is used in John 20:17). It seeks to fulfill the “greater things” in relation to Christ’s great expectations regarding his ascension ministry today (John 14:12). In practical terms, it is to participate in the real and personal advent of Christ through church planting and the ecumenically oriented rediscovery of missional ecclesiology. More than a philosophy of ministry, Mission Anabaino is a theological vision rooted in the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ and his continued salvific presence today applied to mission!
  </p>

  <h3>Our Theological Vision</h3>
  <p>
    Our vision is to plant what we call Total Christ churches. Fifth-century pastor-theologian St. Augustine originated the term “Total Christ” when describing the relationship of Christ’s incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as “the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body” (John 1:14 and Ephesians 1:21-23, 2:19ff). Employing the Chalcedonian formula of “distinct but never separate” of Christology to ecclesiology, Augustine further explained:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Then let us rejoice and give thanks that we are made not only Christians, but Christ. Do you understand, brothers, and apprehend the grace of God upon us? Marvel, be glad, we are made Christ. For if he is the head, we are the members: the whole man is he and we . . . The fullness of Christ, then, is head and members. Head and members, what is that? Christ and the Church!
    <br>
    <em>(St. Augustine, Homilies on the Gospel of John)</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Acknowledging and even celebrating the mystery in all of this, it is our intention to reunite these spiritualities that in modern history tend to be separated — what could be described as a “covenant” theology (gospel-centered) and a “temple” theology (church-centered) of salvation and the gospel. If one stresses the regulative and declarative nature of mission, the other stresses the participational and presence nature of mission – both informed by grace and both at the same time!
  </p>

  <h3>Our Strategy</h3>
  <p>
    Our strategy simply stated is 10-10-10, that is to plant:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ten Congregations Locally</li>
    <li>Ten Church Planting Movements Globally</li>
    <li>In Ten Years</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Locally, we have begun planting congregations in the greater New Haven area that reflect the different voices and locations of our diverse city. Until a Total Christ vision of the gospel is made geographically and/or culturally accessible to each citizen, we will not be finished planting. Globally, in conjunction with our growing MA community and affiliate network, we have begun church planting movements around the world that can themselves continue church planting. Currently, our multiple congregations are already a reflection of one church organically united in beliefs, mission, and a cooperative strategy expressed in a kind of symphonic multiplicity of cultural voices and instruments. We are presently considering many additional opportunities such as in global center cities, college towns, and other major world contexts around the globe.
